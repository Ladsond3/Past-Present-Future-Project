<h1>Ladson's Past, Present and Future</h1>

<h2>My Past</h2>
<img class="right" src="past.PNG" alt="Me playing with lego as a kid.">
<p>I was born on March 20th, 1999, in Shelby, North Carolina. I loved playing with Lego bricks and in my back yard. My best friend was named Matthew. When I was seven years old, my family moved to <a href="http://www.visitgreenvillesc.com/">Greenville, South Carolina</a>. I went to Shannon Forest Christian School for the rest of 1st grade through 3rd grade. For fourth and fifth grade, I went to Pelham Road, then to Beck for middle school, and finally J.L. Mann for high school.</p>

<h3>Five Things That Happened in My Past</h3>

<h2>My Present</h2>

<p>Now, I am seventeen years old. I am a senior at J.L. Mann. This will be my fourth year in the marching band and my first year as the Drumline Captain. I am a Life Scout, actively trying to get my Eagle rank. In my free time, I like to play guitar, hike, watch movies, and eat.</p>
<p>My family lives in a town house in Shadow Moss. My mom owns a vintage furniture store called <a href="http://cottagegrovevintage.com/">Cottage Grove Vintage Market</a>, where I help her move furniture around the store and pick up and deliver items to customers. I am a lifeguard for Sweetwater Pools, where I spent the majority of my summer. Currently, my family has two dogs and one cat. We are also hosting a German exchange student for the year. My dad works downtown for a company called OOBE, which makes apparel for companies such as Chick-fil-a and Krispy Kreme.</p>

<h2>My Future</h2>
<p>I'm not quite sure where I want to go to college. However, I am looking at Clemson, <a href="http://www.sc.edu/">USC</a>, and Wofford as my top three choices. I think I want to go into the medical field for my career, but I am leaving my options open. Hopefully I will get my Eagle Scout rank in the next few months. After that, I'm not sure where my life will take me.</p>
